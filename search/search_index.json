However, the default string representation of Python floats is truncated well below the actual floating point precision. This can result in a loss of precision when injecting floating point values into IDL from Python as documented in this issue. Thus, to ensure that floating point values are accurately represented, hissw provides the <code>force_double_precision</code> filter. This filter can be used as follows, where <code>var</code> is a (scalar or array) variable containing a floating point value,</p> <pre><code>var = {{ var | force_double_precision }}\n</code></pre> <p>This filter uses the builtin <code>float.as_integer_ratio</code> method to represent floating point values as division operations between integer values to ensure that precision is not lost in the string representation Python values in the resulting IDL script. If used in combination with other filters, this filter should be used last.</p>"},{"location":"examples/aia_example/","title":"AIA Response Functions","text":"<p>The temperature response functions of the EUV channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) are used to understand the temperature of the plasma observed by the different telescopes on the instrument.
